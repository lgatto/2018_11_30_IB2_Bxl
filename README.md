# Probabilistic modelling of protein sub-cellular localisation

Slides for my talk at the [Interuniversity Institute of Bioinformatics
in Brussels](https://ibsquare.be/) on the 30 November 2018 (3pm,
Campus de la Plain, ULB, Forum F).

### Abstract

Computational sciences can be and extremely valuable, or arguably
essential, when exploring large and complex bio-medical data. In my
presentation, I will illustrate this claim using examples from my work
on protein sub-cellular localisation using mass spectrometry. I will
present some computational discoveries and developments that helped
putting protein sub-cellular localisation experiments under a new
light, and demonstrate the existing software.
